# Chapter 1: The Beginning

You wake up in a dimly lit room, your head pounding with a dull ache that seems to echo through your very bones. The last thing you remember is the tavern in Millbrook—the sweet taste of honey mead, the bard's melancholic ballad about lovers torn apart by war, and the stranger in the corner whose eyes never left you throughout the evening. Now here you are, in a place that defies all logic and reason.

The room itself is impossible to describe with any certainty. The walls seem to shift between stone and shadow, solid one moment and translucent the next, as if reality here is merely a suggestion rather than a law. The floor beneath your feet feels real enough, cold flagstones worn smooth by countless footsteps, yet when you look down, you can't quite focus on it. It's like trying to remember a dream upon waking—the harder you concentrate, the more it slips away.

But the two doors—ah, the doors are unmistakably, impossibly real. They stand before you like ancient sentinels, each one a portal to unknown destinies. The air is thick with mystery and something else, something you can't quite name but that makes your skin prickle with anticipation. You must choose your path carefully, for you sense with absolute certainty that this choice will echo through the rest of your days, whatever "days" might mean in this strange, liminal space.

The door on the left is made of ancient oak, its surface covered in strange symbols that seem to shimmer in the half-light like stars reflected in dark water. The symbols are familiar somehow, tugging at memories you're not sure you possess—perhaps from dreams, or perhaps from lives you haven't lived yet. A cold draft seeps through its cracks, carrying with it the scent of pine forests, old books, and woodsmoke. You can hear something beyond it too, if you strain your ears: a low chanting, rhythmic and hypnotic, in a language that predates words.

The door on the right is a jarring contrast, made of polished steel so bright it almost hurts to look at directly. It seems out of place here, like a piece of the future dropped into the distant past. A faint humming sound emanates from behind it, steady and electronic, punctuated occasionally by soft beeps and clicks. The metal is warm to the touch—you know this somehow without having touched it yet—and there's a smell of ozone in the air around it, the acrid scent that lingers after lightning strikes.

Between the two doors, you notice something you hadn't seen before: three words carved into the floor in a script that keeps changing language even as you read it. "Choose," "Wisely," and "Remember." Remember what? You rack your aching head, trying to grasp at the threads of memory that dance just beyond your reach. The stranger in the tavern—did they say something important? Did they warn you, or invite you, or curse you?

Your hand instinctively moves to your belt, seeking the reassuring weight of your belongings, but you find only the clothes on your back and, curiously, a small leather journal in your pocket that you don't remember carrying. Its pages are blank, waiting to be filled with the story of your choice. Whatever happens next, you sense, will be written in blood, magic, or perhaps something far stranger.

The room seems to hold its breath, waiting. Even the dust motes suspended in the sickly light have stopped their eternal dance. This is a moment outside of time, a crossroads between worlds. Behind you, there is only darkness—going back is not an option. Forward is the only way, but forward splits into two, and you must decide.

The oak door whispers of ancient wisdom, of paths walked by druids and mystics, of power drawn from the earth itself and the forgotten gods who slumber beneath stone circles. It promises knowledge, but knowledge often comes with a price.

The steel door hums with the promise of progress, of futures bright and terrible, of machines that think and dream, of realities shaped by will and science rather than magic and prayer. It too demands payment, but in currencies you haven't yet imagined.

Which door will you choose?

**If you choose the left door**, embracing the old ways and the mysteries of the past, turn to [Chapter 2](#chapter-2).

**If you choose the right door**, stepping into an uncertain future of chrome and circuitry, turn to [Chapter 42](#chapter-42).

**See markdown examples**, turn to [Chapter 99](#chapter-99).

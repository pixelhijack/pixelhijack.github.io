# Chapter 99: Markdown Example Reference

This chapter demonstrates all the markdown elements you can use in your book chapters.

## Headings

You can use headings from H1 to H3 to structure your content:

### This is a level 3 heading

Headings help organize your content into clear sections.

---

## Paragraphs and Text Formatting

Regular paragraphs are the foundation of your book. Simply write text and separate paragraphs with blank lines.

You can make text **bold** by wrapping it in double asterisks, or _italic_ by using single asterisks. You can also combine them: **_bold and italic_**.

For inline `code` or technical terms, use backticks.

---

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens for bullet points:

- First item in the list
- Second item
- Third item with more detail
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Back to main level

### Ordered Lists

For numbered lists:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
4. Final step

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it for quotes, thoughts, or to emphasize important information.
>
> Blockquotes can span multiple paragraphs.
>
> — Source attribution

---

## Horizontal Rules

You can create section breaks with three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

---

## Code Blocks

For longer code examples or formatted text:

```
This is a code block
It preserves formatting
  Including indentation
And special characters: <>&
```

---

## Links

Create internal chapter links for Fighting Fantasy style navigation:

**If you want to see more examples**, turn to [Chapter 1](#chapter-1).

**If you prefer to explore different paths**, turn to [Chapter 42](#chapter-42).

You can also create regular hyperlinks: [Visit the homepage](/)

---

## Images (Future Enhancement)

While not implemented yet, standard markdown syntax would be:

![Alt text for image](path/to/image.jpg)

---

## Combining Elements

You can **combine** these elements naturally:

> "The key to writing engaging interactive fiction," _the author mused_, "is to make **every choice matter**."

Here's a formatted example with multiple elements:

1. **Start with a hook** - Draw readers in immediately
2. _Build tension_ - Keep them engaged
3. Offer meaningful choices:
   - Each path should feel distinct
   - Consequences should be clear
   - No "wrong" choices, just different experiences

---

## Tips for Writing

- Keep paragraphs readable (not too long)
- Use formatting sparingly for emphasis
- Structure with headings for clarity
- Use blockquotes for character thoughts or important notes
- Cross-reference chapters frequently for interactivity

**Now you're ready to write your adventure!**

To continue your journey, return to [Chapter 1](#chapter-1).
